Base62 conversion functions

This directory contains base62 conversion functions in C, Go, and Python.
Base 62 is fun: it represents numbers using 62 digits picked from digits,
lowercase, and uppercase letters, packing almost 6 bits per character. It
is useful to represent numbers with fewer digits and make sure they are all
printable.

Enjoy!
